# Exporting

## Exporting an image set
Exporting pages are a fundamental part of the Autocomic flow. To share your work with others, you can export the image as a `PDF`, `PNG` or `JPEG`. For any additional work needed on the image, you can export every layer - cleaning, translating, and inpainting - as a `PSD` to continue working on it in Adobe Photoshop.

1. Go to the `My Works` tab
2. Click the desired image set
3. Click the `Export` button
4. Select the pages which you would like to export
    - By default, the entire set will be selected. You can click individual pages or shift click to select multiple pages or deselect. 
    - Pages that are deselected can be added back to the export set by clicking them again, or shift clicking them
5. Select the output format - `PDF`, `PNG`, `JPEG`, `PSD`
    - `PSD` output format will include bubbles, text, inpainting, and raw on separate layers
