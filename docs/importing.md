# Importing Manga

## Creating an image set
Image sets are the basic organization unit in Autocomic. You can use an image set to group certain images belonging to a title together, such as a chapter.
1. Go to the `My Works` tab
2. Click `Create Image Set` to open the set creation modal
3. Choose a name and optionally an identifer to distinguish chapters or versions of the same work and confirm creation

Try it out in the Figma below!

<div style={{position:"relative", "padding-bottom": "56.25%"}}>
    <iframe frameborder="0" style={{border: "1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)", position: "absolute", left:0, top:0}} width="100%" height="100%" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Fproto%2FVMoeNdQpt5F0J7yfq1MfJ9%2FUI%3Fnode-id%3D408%253A406%26scaling%3Dscale-down-width%26page-id%3D0%253A1%26starting-point-node-id%3D408%253A406%26hide-ui=1" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

## Uploading images
To translate comic pages, you will need to upload raws to an image set.
1. Go to the `My Works` tab
2. Create a new image set or select an existing set
3. Click `Upload Images` to open a file browser. Select one or more pages to import
4. All images with parsable image formats (`PDF, PNG, JPEG, PSD`) are added to the set, and warnings are shown for any files that weren't parsable

:::info
Imported PSDs will be flattened into a raster image

5. The image set should now be displayed in your `My Works` tab
6. If additional pages need to be added to the image set, click onto the image set and click the "Add Page" button to open the file explorer again
