# Translating
Autocomic offers automated translation and typesetting for text detected in the manga's pages. However, if our machine translations are not up to standard, the translation tool also provides the ability to manually adjust translations to ensure the final product is as desired.

## Generating automated translations
1. Ensure that the `translation` mode is selected from the dropdown in the top bar
2. Suggested translations and text box locations can be generated using the `Translate` button in the toolbar. This can be repeated to reset the translations to defaults.

<div style={{position:"relative", "padding-bottom": "56.25%"}}>
    <iframe frameborder="0" style={{border: "1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)", position: "absolute", left:0, top:0}} width="100%" height="100%" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Fproto%2FVMoeNdQpt5F0J7yfq1MfJ9%2FUI%3Fnode-id%3D840%253A520%26scaling%3Dscale-down-width%26page-id%3D0%253A1%26starting-point-node-id%3D840%253A520%26hide-ui=1" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

## Modifying suggested translations

Autocomic's translations can be a good starting point for a translation workflow. We know that it is very difficult to capture context with automated translations, so we encourage users to modify and fix translations as needed. Both the text and the placement of the text within the speech bubbles can be adjusted. 

1. Ensure the `translation` mode is selected from the function dropdown in the top bar
2. From the list of translations on the right side, a specific translation can be selected to be changed
3. Once selected:
    a. The text within the speech bubble can be modified
    b. The placement of the text within the speec bubble can be adjusted
4. Select the `Text` tool in the toolbar to create new text boxes

## Previewing results
You can toggle between editing translations and viewing a preview of the final translated and typeset result by pressing the eye button at the bottom right of the page.
